What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository a file called .git is formed.We make repository to have a property of version control with us. 
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the intermediate area where we add one by one all the file which will be later bundled up and stored in one commit in repository.
I don't know much about the value though.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By using git add we send one by one file to staging area and then by using git commit we send all of them together as a commit in repository.So for 
one logical change we will add only those file which are affliated with it.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If we are making some program and we have two approaches to solve it then we can do it by making a branch for one approach.This will help us in being
 highly organised.From a common path branches will allow us to move on two different paths in organised manner.
